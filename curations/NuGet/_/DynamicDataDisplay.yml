      The repository linked in the package's metadata was deleted. However, it is still accessible at Software Heritage,
      see https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/origin/directory/?origin_url=https://github.com/apoydence/DynamicDataDisplay.
      From there, an archive was created from the only commit added on the date when version 0.3.0 was released.
