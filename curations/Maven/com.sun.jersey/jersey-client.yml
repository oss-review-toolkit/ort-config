      All Jersey packages are dual-licensed under CDDL 1.1 or GPL 2 with classpath exception, see
      https://jersey.github.io/license.html. However, the POMs do not declare any license but only contain the license
      text as an XML comment, see e.g.
      https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/sun/jersey/jersey-client/1.9/jersey-client-1.9.pom.
    declared_license_mapping:
      "": "CDDL-1.1 OR GPL-2.0-only WITH Classpath-exception-2.0"

      The POM file lacks a 'licenses' tag but the XML comment at the top says that it is licensed under 'CDDL-1.1 OR
      GPL-2.0-only WITH Classpath-exception-2.0', see
      https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/sun/jersey/jersey-client/1.17.1/jersey-client-1.17.1.pom,
