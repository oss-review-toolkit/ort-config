      The POM file lacks a 'licenses' tag but the XML comment at the top says that it is licensed under 'CDDL-1.1 OR
      GPL-2.0-only WITH Classpath-exception-2.0', see
      https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/sun/jersey/jersey-core/1.17.1/jersey-core-1.17.1.pom,
      https://web.archive.org/web/20150923052903/https://glassfish.java.net/public/faq/GF_FAQ_2.html#terms and
      https://web.archive.org/web/20170430040528/https://glassfish.java.net/public/CDDL+GPL_1_1.html. The scan
      additionally detects the 'Apache-2.0', 'CDDL-1.0', 'CDDL-1.1' and 'MIT' licenses. The 'MIT' license is just found
      in 'javax/ws/rs/core/GenericEntity.java' which is a false positive. The 'Apache-2.0' and 'CDDL-1-0' licenses are
      valid findings inside several source
      files.

      All Jersey packages are dual-licensed under CDDL 1.1 or GPL 2 with classpath exception, see
      https://jersey.github.io/license.html. However, the POMs do not declare any license but only contain the license
      text as an XML comment, see e.g.
      https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/sun/jersey/jersey-core/1.9/jersey-core-1.9.pom.
