      All Jersey packages are dual-licensed under CDDL 1.1 or GPL 2 with classpath exception, see
      https://jersey.github.io/license.html. However, the POMs do not declare any license but only contain the license
      text as an XML comment, see e.g.
      https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/sun/jersey/jersey-core/1.9/jersey-core-1.9.pom.

      "": "CDDL-1.1 OR GPL-2.0-only WITH Classpath-exception-2.0"
