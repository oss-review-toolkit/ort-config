      Old versions of jFormatString do not have a sources artifact published and the original repo at
      https://findbugs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ is gone as Google Code did shut down. However, the new GitHub home has
      jFormatString.jar committed, and it includes the source code (and class files). License concluded based on links
      below and the license stated in various *.java files in jFormatString.jar.
