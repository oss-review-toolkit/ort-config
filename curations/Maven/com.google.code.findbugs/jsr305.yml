      The Subversion repository at https://findbugs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ has been moved to GitHub.
    vcs:
      type: "Git"
      url: "https://github.com/findbugsproject/findbugs.git"
      path: "findbugs"
- id: "Maven:com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:1.3.9"

      Old versions of jsr305 do not have a sources artifact published and the original repo at
      https://findbugs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ is gone as Google Code did shut down. However, the new GitHub home has
      jsr305.jar committed, and it includes the source code (and class
      files).
    source_artifact:
      url: "https://github.com/findbugsproject/findbugs/raw/1.3.9/findbugs/lib/jsr305.jar"
      hash:
        value: "516c03b21d50a644d538de0f0369c620989cd8f0"
        algorithm: "SHA-1"
