      The `pom.xml` and `LICENSE` files say that it is licensed under the Apache-2.0. Additionally detected licenses
      are LicenseRef-scancode-proprietary, LicenseRef-scancode-public-domain and MIT which all refer to either
      `model.json` or `intermediate.json`. All these are references to non-applicable licenses. Concluding the license
      for all current and future versions as this package always contains data models (not code) that are used by other
      AWS libraries. Examples: 'AWS Billing and Cost Management User Guide', 'For example, MIT', and 'For example,
      https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT'.
