      The declared license is incorrect. Mapping declared license based on
      https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib/blob/v1.3.1/LICENSE,
      https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib/blob/v1.3.1/setup.py#L49 and
      https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib/blob/v1.3.1/setup.py#L54.
    declared_license_mapping:
      "BSD License": "ISC"
